	    <p> Welcome to my website for L I S 351 Introduction to Digital Information, 
	    which is a course I am taking at the University of Wisconsin-Madison this Spring 2023 Semester.
	    Throughout this course, we are learning about and preparing to use digital technologies such as
	    implementing websites with HTML and CSS. </p>

	    <p> As I am a senior and plan on leaving the Madison area after this semester, I wanted to reminisce on some of my favorite things about Madison, Wisconsin 
	    for this project.  In this website, I will list and discuss my favorite classes at UW-Madison, some of my favorite study spots I have found while taking 
	    classes here, and finally my favorite restaurants in the Madison area. </p>

	    <h2> <u> About Me</u>: </h2>

		<p> My name is Olivia, and I am a fourth year student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Data Science, Mathematics
		and Global Health.  This Spring 2023 semester is my final semester here at UW-Madison before I plan to continue my studies in 
		a graduate program.  I am originally from Sartell, Minnesota, and in my free time I enjoy roller blading, spending time on the lake, 
		and reading. </p>
