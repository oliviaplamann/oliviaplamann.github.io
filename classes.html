		    <li> <section> <strong> COMP SCI 220: Data Programming I and COMP SCI 320: Data Programming II </strong>
		    <ul>
		        <li> <u> Professors</u>: Meena Syamkumar and Tyler Harter </li>
		        <li> I may be biased as I am studying Data Science, but I really enjoyed both of these courses together as I felt they introduced me to programming 
		        in Python through incredibly interesting real-world projects. </li>
		    </ul> </section> </li>
		    
		    
		    <li> <section> <strong> ENTOM 205: Our Planet Our Health </strong>
		    <ul>
		        <li> <u>Professors</u>: Susan Paskewitz, Valerie Stull, and Jonathan Patz </li>
		        <li> In Entom 205, I learned a lot about the different interactions between humans and the environment and how all these interactions can impact 
		        human and environmental health.  This course introduced me to a lot of fundamental ideas pertaining to global health. </li>
		    </ul> </section> </li>
		    
		    
		    <li> <section> <strong> MATH 222: Calculus II </strong>
		    <ul>
		        <li> <u>Professor</u>: Daniel Erman </li>
		        <li> Calculus II might be a shocking favorite class as it tends to be considered one of the harder courses that students can take here at UW-Madison. 
		         However, Professor Daniel Erman truly made this one of my favorite classes I have taken here at UW-Madison.  Professor Erman was extremely caring
		         and attentive to students' needs, and overall he just simply made the class fun. </li>
		    </ul> </section> </li>
		    
		    
		    <li> <section> <strong> CSNR SCI 321: Financial Life Skills for Life After Graduation </strong>
		    <ul>
		        <li> <u>Professor</u>: Lindsay Dritsas </li>
		        <li> This course taught me a lot about how my finances will change after graduation as well as the skills necessary in order to be as 
		        successful financially as possible.  I learned a lot about taxes, loans, credit, and more skills that I believe I can apply in my life 
		        after graduation. Overall, this was one of the most valuable courses I have taken here at UW-Madison. </li>
		    </ul> </section> </li>
		    
		    
		    <li> <section> <strong> PSYCH 202: Introduction to Psychology </strong>
		    <ul>
		        <li> <u>Professor</u>: Shawn Green </li>
		        <li> I really enjoyed this Introduction to Psychology course taught by Professor Shawn Green.  Professor Green learned everyone’s names in a lecture
		         of around 500 students, which felt very validating and impressive to me.  Regardless of Professor Green’s ability to learn every student’s name, 
		         he also helped me to learn ways to study materials not only for this Introduction to Psychology class but also any class I take at UW-Madison 
		         in order to actually learn the material rather than just to do well on an exam. </li>
