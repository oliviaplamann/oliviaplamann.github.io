		        <dd> <section> Cento is an itallian restaurant located in downtown Madison near the capital. My favorite dishes from Cento are the spaghetti and gnocchi,
		         pictured here.  Cento has a really extensive menu, and it was difficult to choose just one dish to eat!  The spaghetti was delicious and you 
		         could definitely tell the noodles and sauce were both home-made.  The gnocchi was also super tasty with good flavor.  
		         I am excited to go back and try the rest of the menu! </section>

		        <dd> <section> Paul's Pelmeni serves russian dumplings downtown Madison closer to campus near State Street.  My favorite version of the 
		        dumplings are the full potato with what they call <i>the works</i>.  <i>The works</i> includes all the toppings Paul's has, including
		        butter, curry powder, and even sour cream.  You can also get the dumplings with beef or half with beef and potato.  I am vegetarian,
		        so I have not tried the beef, but I have heard they are just as amazing. </section> <p> </p></dd>
		    
		    
		       
		    <dt> <a href="https://www.swagatmadison.com/">Swagat</a> </dt>
		        <dd> <section> Another of my favorite restaurants in the Madison area is Swagat, which serves Indian Cuisine.  Swagat is a bit further from downtown
		        and is located on the west side of Madison near Middleton.  They also have a second location near Sun Prarie.  My favorite things to order from 
		        Swagat are the Paneer Tikka Massala, which was super creamy and delicious.  I also really enjoyed their Garlic Naan and Mango Lassi.  I  am 
		        excited to go back to Swagat and try more of their extensive menu. </section> </dd>
